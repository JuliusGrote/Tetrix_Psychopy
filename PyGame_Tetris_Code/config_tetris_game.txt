## General design settings

### Pretrial? Note: When using the Tetris_Psychopy Experiment, this setting will be overwritten when the experiment starts.
### For more Info see: "load_processes" Routine --> "create_processes" code --> "Before Experiment" tab --> "Tetris_Instance()" function 
### Default: True
config_pretrial = True

### How many rounds of pretrial should be played? This is not overwritten in "Tetris_Psychopy" and important for your experimental design.
### Default and recommended: 3
config_pretrial_rounds = 3

### Should a seed for the randomizer be used to generate:

### 1. Movements of visual control (watch_Tetris) so that the movements are the same for each participant/each time running the experiment? 
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "visual_seed" to any number.
visual_seed = None

### 2. Which block is chosen each time a new block is needed so that the choice is the same for each participant/each time running the experiment? 
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "block_seed" to any number.
block_seed = None


### Should the score be kept after "game over"
Keep_score = True

### Should the game restart automatically after "game over"?
### Default and recommended: True
restart_automatically = True

### determines whether game starts in Fullscreen or not
### Default: False 
### Overwritten, if you use the "Tetris_Psychopy" Experiment
Start_Fullscreen = False

### determines whether game starts paused or not
### Default and strongly recommended for "Tetris_Psychopy": True
Start_Pause = True

### Setting for visual control purposes, blocks get deleted when reaching the bottom of the grid, no stacking. Blocks move in a random pattern simulation actual gameplay.
### Similar to the Pretrial setting, when using "Tetris_Psychopy", this setting will be overwritten at the start of the experiment.
Visual_control = False

### Should there be three "next" blocks instead of one on the screen?
### If you enabled the "toggle_wm_load" option in the "config_paradigm_psyhopy.txt", this option here only relates to the "Pre-Trials"
### With reference to the current Tetris mobile app and online game, in "marathon mode", there are three "next" blocks and in the "level mode" there is only one "next" block.
toggle_three_next_blocks = True

## Level Design

### determines how many lines need to be cleared in order to reach the next level
Lines_for_levelup = 3

### determine at which level to start
Start_level = 1

### do you want to keep the level progression for the "Main Trials"?
level_progression_main = True

## Game speed

## Speed in "ms/line": time that a block needs to move down one cell on the grid, correlates to game difficulty
## Speed per level described by this formula in "ms": self.speed = round((Start_speed/1250 - ((level - 1) * speed_slope)) ** (level - 1) * 1000) mimicking the original Tetris progression

###  Start_speed determines game speed at level 1 and also how fast game difficulty progresses. 
### Default: 1000 
Start_speed = 1000

### Speed_slope also determines how fast the game progresses... 
### Default: 0.007
Speed_slope = 0.007
