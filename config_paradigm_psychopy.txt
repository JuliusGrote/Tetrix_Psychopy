# Config for overarching paradigm settings

## Instruction language
## Choose either "german" or "english"!
Language = "german"

## Trials settings

### How many Pre-Trial rounds should be played or what Pre-Trial design?
### --> see "config_tetris_game.txt"

### Do you want to use a random seed for the main trials so that the random choice of control conditions is the same for each participant/each time running the experiment? 
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "main_trials_seed" to any number.
Main_trials_seed = None

### Duration for all conditions in sec.
### Default and strongly recommended: 20
Targeted_duration = 20

### How often should each control condition occur
### Also sets the number of Trials! 
### Each trial consists of "play_Tetris" followed by a randomly chosen control condition!
### Default: 10; 3 control conditions ("watch_Tetris", "motor_control", "fixation_cross") --> 10 * 3 = 30 trials
N_repeats = 10


### Would you like to compare "high_load" working memory load (WM load) against "low_load" working memory load (WM load) (one "NEXT" Block against three "NEXT" BLocks)? 
### Each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether wm_load is "high_load" or "low_load"!
### uses the same mechanic as the "three_next_blocks" option from "config_tetris_game.txt"
Comp_wm_load = False

### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "load_seed" to any number.
Load_seed = None


### Would you like to compare "high_speed" "game.speed/level" against "low_speed" in the main Trials  
### Each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether "game.speed/level" is either "high_speed" or "low_speed"  
### only works properly if level "Level_progression_main = False" in "config_tetris_game.txt"
Comp_speed = True

### How many levels lower should the "low_speed" condition / how many levels higher should the "high_speed" condition be compared to "game.level_for_main.value" (individual level for "main_trials")
Plus_level = 1
Minus_level = 1

### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "speed_seed" to any number.
Speed_seed = None


### Toggle rhythmic cross during motor_control, frequency based on game.speed
Show_motor_rhythm = True


## Keys

### Determine whether to use a test keyset for pygame (Tetris gameplay) or not 
Test_keys = True

### Define which keys to use in pygame
if Test_keys == True:
	### Test keys
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_DOWN # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_LEFT # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_UP # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_RIGHT # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key
else:
	### Keys to use in the actual experiment
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_6 # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_7 # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_8 # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_9 # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key

### Define which keys to use in Psychopy to 'continue', should be according to the keys used above
psychopy_key_1 = '6'
psychopy_key_2 = '7'
psychopy_key_3 = '8'
psychopy_key_4 = '9'
psychopy_key_5 = '0'


## Define trigger signal
## This only works if your Trigger signal can be converted to a char/letter, i.e. via an according responsebox.
Trigger = 't'

## Toggle display flip (mirroring)

### Left --> <-- Right
Flip_vertically = False

### Up | ^
###    v | Down
Flip_horizontally = False


## Toggle eye tracking
## Feature not fully developed yet!
Eye_tracking = False
