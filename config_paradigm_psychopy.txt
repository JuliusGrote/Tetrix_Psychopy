# Config for overarching paradigm settings.
# Make sure file can be executed as a python script!

## Instruction language
## Choose either "German" or "English"!

#------
Language = "German"
#------

## Explanation settings

### Should the explanations be excluded in the experiment? (excludes explanation routines in "Tetrix_PsychoPy")
### You might want to disable them for testing or if you want to use Tetrix for a different purpose)
### Default: False

#------
Exclude_explanations = True
#------


## Trial settings

### How many Pre-Trial rounds should be played or what Pre-Trial design?
### --> see "config_tetris_game.txt"

### How often should each (control) condition occur?

### Also sets the number of trials! 
### Each trial consists of "play_Tetris" followed by a randomly chosen "control_condition"!
### Default: 10; 3 control conditions ("watch_Tetris", "motor_control", "fixation_cross") --> 10 * 3 = 30 trials
### If you want to use both "Comp_wm_load" and "Comp_speed" (--> 4 total combinations) this number should be dividable by 4 (e.g. 12)!
### If you only want to use the pretrials (e.g. for behavioral experiments) and no "main_trials" set this to "N_repeats = None" (explanatory routines in "Tetrix_PsychoPy.psyexp" are disabled accordingly)

#------
N_repeats = 1
#------

### Do you want to use a random seed for the "main_trials" so that the random choice of "control_conditions" is the same for each participant/each time running the experiment? 
### The same condition is at max. chosen two times in a row.
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "Main_trials_seed" to any number.

#------
Main_trials_seed = 1
#------

### Durations for each conditions in sec.
### It is recommended to keep the durations of the conditions the same (except the baseline), but you can adjust them if you want to.
### To disable a condition set the duration to "None" or 0 (explanatory routines in "Tetrix_PsychoPy.psyexp" are disabled accordingly)
### Default: 30 (strongly recommended: 20-30, not more than 50)
### Baseline/fixation_cross: 15 (half the duration of the other conditions)


#------
Play_Tetris_duration = 15

Watch_Tetris_duration = 15

Motor_control_duration = 15

Fixation_cross_duration = None
#------

### Interstimulus Interval Variation

### Should the interstimulus interval vary? (better sampling of the HRF)
### Here the interstimulus interval relates to the time in between "play_Tetris" and the random "control_condition" as well as between the "control_condition" and the next "play_Tetris"!
### Default and recommended: True

#------
ISI_variation = True
#------

### Do you want to use a random seed for the "ISI_variation" so that the random choice of is the same for each participant/each time running the experiment?
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "ISI_seed" to any number.

#------
ISI_seed = None
#------

### If "ISI_variation = True", what should the upper/lower limit of the variation be?
### ISI_variation adds a random value (in 0.1sec increments) between "ISI_lower" and "ISI_upper" to the already 7sec-default ISI (all routines between two conditions combined).
### Default lower: -1.0
### Default upper: 1

#------
ISI_lower = -1.0
#------

#------
ISI_upper = 1.0
#------

## Pause 

### Should there be a pause between the "pretrial" and "main_trials" of "Pause_sec" seconds?
### Default: 30, If you do not want to use that option set it to "None".

#------
Pause_sec = 30
#------

## Control condition settings

## Replay

### Should the visual control condition be an exact replay of the movements performed during the play tetris block? (config_tetris_game.txt)
### If True, the visual control will replay the recorded movements. If False, it uses the random logic.
### Default: False

#------
Replay_movements = True
#------

### Should blocks stack in the visual control condition?
### If True, blocks will stack at the bottom. If False, they will disappear when reaching the bottom.
### Usually, stacking should only be used when "Replay_movements = True".
### Default: False

#------
Stack_in_visual_control = False
#------

### Toggle rhythmic shape during "motor_control", frequency based on "game.speed"

#------
Show_motor_rhythm = True
#------

### Should the motor control condition use the replay of player input from the last trial to indicate when to press?
### If True, the visual replay (showing tetris blocks) will be displayed during the motor control phase.
### If False, rhythm is based on the main trial level.
### Default: True

#------
Replay_indication_motor = True
#------

### Mode of rhythmic shape: "exact" (replay exact timing from last trial) or "average" (replay average frequency)
### Only works if "Replay_indication_motor = True", otherwise the motor control rhythm is based on "game.speed".
### Default: "exact"

#------
Motor_control_mode = "average"
#------

### Which symbol should be displayed (choose either "button" -  this is the icon from the instructions - or "shape")
### If you want "Motor_symbol = shape", you can adjust which shape in the "press_shape" stimulus in the "random_control_condition" routine in "Tetrix_PsychoPy.psyexp".

#------
Motor_symbol = "button"
#------

### what should be the minimum temporal gap between each motor control signals/visual stimulus (in sec.)?
### Default: 0.1 sec.

#------
Min_gap = 0.1
#------


## Play_Tetris settings

### Would you like to compare "high_load" working memory load (wm_load) against "low_load" working memory load (one "NEXT" Tetris-block  vs. three "NEXT" Tetris-block s)? 
### In each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether "wm_load" is "high_load" or "low_load"!
### Uses the same mechanic as the "three_next_blocks" setting from "config_tetris_game.txt"

#------
Comp_wm_load = False
#------

### Default: None; if you want to use that setting set "load_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).

#------
Load_seed = None
#------

### Would you like to compare "high_speed" "game.speed/level" against "low_speed" in the main Trials?  
### In each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether "game.speed/level" is either "high_speed" or "low_speed".
### If you want to use that setting it is recommended that level progression ("Level_progression_main = False" in "config_tetris_game.txt") for the "main_trials" is disabled.

#------
Comp_speed = False
#------

### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "speed_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).

#------
Speed_seed = None
#------

### How many levels lower should the "low_speed" condition / how many levels higher/lower should the "high_speed" condition be compared to "game.level_for_main.value" (individual level for "main_trials")
### Please indicate your level as positive OR negative (e.g. if you want to go a level lower use "-1"!)
### Recommended values here depend on the "pretrial" design you choose and what value your "Level_for_main_factor" in "config_tetris_game.txt" has.

#------
High_level = +1
#------

#------
Low_level = -2
#------

### If you have both comparisons enabled a different method is used to ensure that each possible combination "speed" and "wm_load" conditions occurs equally often!
### Do you want to set a seed for this combination randomization?
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "speed_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).

#------
Comp_all_seed = None
#------


## Keys

### Determine whether to use a test keyset for pygame (Tetris gameplay) or not 

#------
Test_keys = True
#------

### Define which keys to use in pygame

#------
if Test_keys == True: ### Do not change this line of code!
	### Test keys:
	Pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_DOWN # Move Tetris-block down
	Pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_LEFT # Move Tetris-block left

	Pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_7 # Move Tetris-block left 
	Pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_8 # Rotate Tetris-block 
	Pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_9 # Move Tetris-block right
	Pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key
#------

### Define which keys to use in Psychopy to use "press_continue" (continue to next routine) in "Tetrix_PsychoPy.psyexp", should be according to the keys used above for pygame!

#------
psychopy_key_1 = '6'
psychopy_key_2 = '7'
psychopy_key_3 = '8'
psychopy_key_4 = '9'
psychopy_key_5 = '0'
#------


## Define trigger signal

### This only works if your Trigger signal can be converted to a character, i.e. via an according response box!
### Default: 't'

#------
Trigger = 't'
#------


## Display Mirroring

### Toggle display flip (mirroring)

### Left --> 
###         <-- Right

Flip_vertically = False
#------

### Up | ^
###    v | Down

#------
Flip_horizontally = False
#------


## Toggle eye tracking

### Feature not fully developed yet, you might want to add ROIs, etc. in "Tetrix_PsychoPy.psyexp"!
### The Eye tracking component is started in the "play_pretrial" routine in "Tetrix_PsychoPy.psyexp" and stopped in the "end" routine.

#------
Eye_tracking = False
#------


## Logfile

### Which columns of the generated .csv logfile should be excluded?
### By default PsychoPy includes a lot of columns that are not relevant for Tetrix
### Edit the list as you see fit!

#------
Drop_columns = [
    'main_trials.thisIndex', 'main_trials.thisRepN', 'main_trials.thisTrialN', # trial related indexing
    'date', 'control_condition', 'images_next_cond', 'notes' # redundant info
]
