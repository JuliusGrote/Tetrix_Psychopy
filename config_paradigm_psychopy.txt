# Config for overarching paradigm settings.
# Make sure file can be executed as a python script!

## Instruction language
## Choose either "German" or "English"!

#------
Language = "German"
#------


## Trial settings

### How many Pre-Trial rounds should be played or what Pre-Trial design?
### --> see "config_tetris_game.txt"

### Do you want to use a random seed for the "main_trials" so that the random choice of "control_conditions" is the same for each participant/each time running the experiment? 
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "main_trials_seed" to any number.

#------
Main_trials_seed = 5
#------

### Duration for all conditions in sec.
### Default: 20 (strongly recommended: 20-30)

#------
Targeted_duration = 20
#------

### Pause 

### Should there be a pause between the "pretrial" and "main_trials" of "Pause_sec" seconds?
### Default: 30, If you do not want to use that option set it to "None".

#------
Pause_sec = 30
#------

### Control condition settings

### By default (and recommended), all control conditions are included. If you to exclude a specific control condition, you can remove its line from the excel table in "main_trials_template.xlsx" (make sure to also exclude routines in "Tetris_Psychopy.psyexp" that explain the excluded control condition(s))

### How often should each control condition occur?
### Also sets the number of Trials! 
### Each trial consists of "play_Tetris" followed by a randomly chosen "control_condition"!
### Default: 10; 3 control conditions ("watch_Tetris", "motor_control", "fixation_cross") --> 10 * 3 = 30 trials
### If you want to use both "Comp_wm_load" and "Comp_speed" (--> 4 total combinations) this number should be dividable by 4 (e.g. 12)!
### If you only want to use the pretrials (e.g. for Behavioral experiments) and no "main_trials" set this to "N_repeats = None" (explanatory routines in "Tetris_psychopy.psyexp" are disabled accordingly)

#------
N_repeats = 10
#------

### Toggle rhythmic shape during "motor_control", frequency based on "game.speed"

#------
Show_motor_rhythm = True
#------

### Which symbol should be displayed (choose either "button" -  this is the icon from the instructions - or "shape")
### If you want "Motor_symbol = shape", you can adjust which shape in the "press_shape" stimulus in the "random_control_condition" routine in "Tetris_Psychopy.psyexp".

#------
Motor_symbol = "button"
#------

### Play_Tetris settings

### Would you like to compare "high_load" working memory load (wm_load) against "low_load" working memory load (one "NEXT" Block vs. three "NEXT" BLocks)? 
### In each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether "wm_load" is "high_load" or "low_load"!
### Uses the same mechanic as the "three_next_blocks" setting from "config_tetris_game.txt"

#------
Comp_wm_load = False
#------

### Default: None; if you want to use that setting set "load_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).

#------
Load_seed = None
#------

### Would you like to compare "high_speed" "game.speed/level" against "low_speed" in the main Trials?  
### In each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether "game.speed/level" is either "high_speed" or "low_speed".
### If you want to use that setting it is recommended that level progression ("Level_progression_main = False" in "config_tetris_game.txt") for the "main_trials" is disabled.

#------
Comp_speed = False
#------

### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "speed_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).

#------
Speed_seed = None
#------

### How many levels lower should the "low_speed" condition / how many levels higher/lower should the "high_speed" condition be compared to "game.level_for_main.value" (individual level for "main_trials")
### Please indicate your level as positive OR negative (e.g. if you want to go a level lower use "-1"!)
### Recommended values here depend on the "pretrial" design you choose and what value your "Level_for_main_factor" in "config_tetris_game.txt" has.

#------
High_level = +1
#------

#------
Low_level = -2
#------

### If you have both comparisons enabled a different method is used to ensure that each possible combination "speed" and "wm_load" conditions occurs equally often!
### Do you want to set a seed for this combination randomization?
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "speed_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).

#------
Comp_all_seed = None
#------


## Keys

### Determine whether to use a test keyset for pygame (Tetris gameplay) or not 

#------
Test_keys = True
#------

### Define which keys to use in pygame

#------
if Test_keys == True: ### Do not change this line of code!
	### Test keys:
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_DOWN # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_LEFT # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_UP # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_RIGHT # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key
else: 	### Do not change this line of code!
	### Keys to use in the actual experiment:
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_6 # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_7 # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_8 # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_9 # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key
#------

### Define which keys to use in Psychopy to use "press_continue" (continue to next routine) in "Tetris_Psychopy.psyexp", should be according to the keys used above for pygame!

#------
psychopy_key_1 = '6'
psychopy_key_2 = '7'
psychopy_key_3 = '8'
psychopy_key_4 = '9'
psychopy_key_5 = '0'
#------


## Define trigger signal

### This only works if your Trigger signal can be converted to a char/letter, i.e. via an according response box!
### Default: 't'

#------
Trigger = 't'
#------


## Display Mirroring

### Toggle display flip (mirroring)

### Left --> 
###         <-- Right

#------
Flip_vertically = False
#------

### Up | ^
###    v | Down

#------
Flip_horizontally = False
#------


## Toggle eye tracking

### Feature not fully developed yet, you might want to add ROIs, etc. in "Tetris_Psychopy.psyexp"!
### Eye tracker is started in the "play_pretrial" routine in "Tetris_Psychopy.psyexp" and stopped in the "end" routine.

#------
Eye_tracking = False
