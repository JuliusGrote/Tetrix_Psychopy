# Config for overarching paradigm settings

## Instruction language
## Choose either "German" or "English"!
Language = "German"


## Trial settings

### How many Pre-Trial rounds should be played or what Pre-Trial design?
### --> see "config_tetris_game.txt"

### Do you want to use a random seed for the main trials so that the random choice of control conditions is the same for each participant/each time running the experiment? 
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "main_trials_seed" to any number.
Main_trials_seed = None

### Duration for all conditions in sec.
### Default and strongly recommended: 20
Targeted_duration = 20

### Control condition settings

### By default (and recommended), all control conditions are included. If you to exclude a specific control condition, you can remove its line from the excel table in "main_trials_template.xlsx" (make sure to also exclude routines in "Tetris_Psychopy.psyexp" that explain the excluded control condition(s))

### How often should each control condition occur?
### Also sets the number of Trials! 
### Each trial consists of "play_Tetris" followed by a randomly chosen control condition!
### Default: 10; 3 control conditions ("watch_Tetris", "motor_control", "fixation_cross") --> 10 * 3 = 30 trials
### If you want to use both "Comp_wm_load" and "Comp_speed" (--> 4 total combinations) this number should be dividable by 4 (e.g. 12)
### If you only want to use the pretrials (e.g. for Behavioral experiments) and no "main_trials" set this to "N_repeats = None" (explanatory routines in "Tetris_psychopy.psyexp" are disabled accordingly)
N_repeats = 10

### Toggle rhythmic cross during motor_control, frequency based on game.speed
Show_motor_rhythm = True

### Play_Tetris settings

### Would you like to compare "high_load" working memory load (WM load) against "low_load" working memory load (WM load) (one "NEXT" Block against three "NEXT" BLocks)? 
### Each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether wm_load is "high_load" or "low_load"!
### uses the same mechanic as the "three_next_blocks" option from "config_tetris_game.txt"
Comp_wm_load = True

### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "load_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).
Load_seed = None

### Would you like to compare "high_speed" "game.speed/level" against "low_speed" in the main Trials  
### Each "play_Tetris" condition it is randomly chosen whether "game.speed/level" is either "high_speed" or "low_speed"  
### only works properly if level "Level_progression_main = False" in "config_tetris_game.txt"
Comp_speed = False

### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "speed_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).
Speed_seed = None

### How many levels lower should the "low_speed" condition / how many levels higher/lower should the "high_speed" condition be compared to "game.level_for_main.value" (individual level for "main_trials")
### please indicate your level as positive OR negative (e.g. if you want to go a level lower use "-1"!)
### When using the "Jnd_regression" option from "config_tetris_game.txt" it is recommended to set both to negative values, since the JND is the upper limit for consistend Gameplay for each specific subject (take into account your setting of "Level_for_main_factor" in "config_tetris_game.txt"!).
High_level = -1
Low_level = -3

### if you have both comparisons enabled are different method is used to also ensure that each possible combination "speed" and "wm_load" conditions occurs equally often 
### do you want to set a seed for this combination randomization?
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "speed_seed" to any number (ensures the same random order for each participant --> pseudorandomization).
Comp_all_seed = True

## Keys

### Determine whether to use a test keyset for pygame (Tetris gameplay) or not 
Test_keys = True

### Define which keys to use in pygame
if Test_keys == True:
	### Test keys
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_DOWN # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_LEFT # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_UP # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_RIGHT # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key
else:
	### Keys to use in the actual experiment
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_6 # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_7 # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_8 # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_9 # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key

### Define which keys to use in Psychopy to 'continue', should be according to the keys used above
psychopy_key_1 = '6'
psychopy_key_2 = '7'
psychopy_key_3 = '8'
psychopy_key_4 = '9'
psychopy_key_5 = '0'


## Define trigger signal

### This only works if your Trigger signal can be converted to a char/letter, i.e. via an according responsebox.
Trigger = 't'


## Display Mirroring

###Toggle display flip (mirroring)

### Left --> <-- Right
Flip_vertically = False

### Up | ^
###    v | Down
Flip_horizontally = False

## Toggle eye tracking

### Feature not fully developed yet!
Eye_tracking = False
