#Config for overarching paradigm settings


## Trials settings

### How many pretrial rounds should be played?
### --> see "config_tetris_game.txt"

### Do you want to use a random seed for the main trials so that the random choice of control conditions is the same for each participant/each time running the experiment? 
### Default: None; if you want to use that function set "main_trials_seed" to any number.
main_trials_seed = None

### Duration for all conditions in sec.
### Default and strongly recommended: 20
targeted_duration = 20

### How often should each control condition occur 
### Each trial consists of "play_Tetris" followed by a randomly chosen control condition!
### Default: 10; 3 control conditions ("watch_Tetris", "motor_control", "fixation_cross") --> 10 * 3 = 30 trials
n_repeats = 10

### Toggle rhythmic cross during motor_control, frequency based on game.speed
show_motor_rhythm = True


## Keys

### Determine whether to use a test keyset for pygame (Tetris gameplay) or not 
test_keys = True

### Define which keys to use in pygame
if test_keys == True:
	### Test keys
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_DOWN # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_LEFT # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_UP # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_RIGHT # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key
else:
	### Keys to use in the actual experiment
	pygame_key_1 = pygame.K_6 # Move Tetris Block down
	pygame_key_2 = pygame.K_7 # Move Tetris Block left 
	pygame_key_3 = pygame.K_8 # Rotate Tetris Block
	pygame_key_4 = pygame.K_9 # Move Tetris Block right
	pygame_key_5 = pygame.K_0 # Spare key

### Define which keys to use in Psychopy to 'continue', should be according to the keys used above
psychopy_key_1 = '6'
psychopy_key_2 = '7'
psychopy_key_3 = '8'
psychopy_key_4 = '9'
psychopy_key_5 = '0'


## Define trigger signal
## This only works if your Trigger signal can be converted to a char/letter, i.e. via an according responsebox.
trigger = 't'

## Toggle display flip (mirroring)

### Left --> <-- Right
flip_vertically = False

### Up | ^
###    v | Down
flip_horizontally = False


## Toggle eye tracking
## feature not fully developed yet
eye_tracking = False
